## üß© **GROUP 1 ‚Äì Smart Temperature & Weather Alert**

**Goal:** Convert temperature, display weather category, and store multiple records.
**Concepts:** Variables, Lists, Loops, If-Else, Functions

**New Features:**

* Accept multiple temperature inputs (loop until user types ‚Äústop‚Äù).
* Store conversions in a **list of dictionaries**.
* Function `convert_temp(value, unit)` handles both conversions.
* Function `analyze_weather(celsius)` categorizes conditions.
* At the end, display an average temperature summary.

**Sample Flow:**

```python
# Output Example
Enter temp (C/F or 'stop'): 30C
30¬∞C = 86¬∞F | Pleasant Day
Enter temp (C/F or 'stop'): 100F
100¬∞F = 37.78¬∞C | Hot Day
Enter temp (C/F or 'stop'): stop

Average: 33.89¬∞C | Overall: Warm Climate
```

## üßÆ **GROUP 2 ‚Äì Student Grading & Performance Analyzer**

**Goal:** Manage multiple students, compute GPA, and assign class honors.
**Concepts:** Lists, Dictionaries, Loops, Functions, Decisions

**New Features:**

* Loop for multiple students; stop when ‚Äúexit‚Äù is typed.
* Store each student‚Äôs name, grades, GPA, and remark in a **dictionary**.
* Function `compute_gpa(grades)` and `remark(gpa)` handle logic.
* End report shows class average and top performer.

**Sample Flow:**

```python
Student Name: Aria
Enter 5 grades: 90 85 88 92 91
GPA: 89.2 | Remark: Satisfactory

Student Name: Leo
Enter 5 grades: 95 94 96 93 97
GPA: 95.0 | Remark: Outstanding

Class Average: 92.1 | Top Student: Leo
```

## üí∞ **GROUP 3 ‚Äì ATM System with Security, Transaction Logs & Receipt**

**Goal:** Build a secure ATM simulation with login, balance tracking, and receipts.
**Concepts:** While Loops, If-Else, Functions, Lists, Strings

**New Features:**

* PIN login with lockout after 3 failed attempts.
* Separate functions: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `check_balance()`, `print_receipt()`.
* Maintain a **transaction log list** recording each operation.
* Add option to show all transactions before exit.
* Print a mini ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù at the end with totals.

**Sample Flow:**

```
Enter PIN: 1234

## ‚öïÔ∏è **GROUP 4 ‚Äì BMI & Health Recommendation System**

**Goal:** Compute BMI for multiple users, classify health, and provide recommendations.
**Concepts:** Functions, Lists, If-Else, Loops, String Formatting

**New Features:**

* Function `bmi(weight, height)` and `recommendation(status)` for advice.
* Loop for multiple users (family health tracker).
* Store results in a **list of dictionaries** with names, BMI, and status.
* Add logic for ideal weight range based on height.
* Display overall health summary (how many are normal/overweight/etc.).

**Sample Flow:**

```
Name: Sarah | BMI: 23.5 | Status: Normal | Advice: Keep balanced meals.
Name: Kai | BMI: 29.2 | Status: Overweight | Advice: Regular exercise needed.
Summary: 1 Normal, 1 Overweight
```

## üõí **GROUP 5 ‚Äì E-Commerce Cart & Discount System**

**Goal:** Create a smart shopping cart with categories, discounts, and inventory check.
**Concepts:** Lists, Dictionaries, Loops, Functions, Math Operators

**New Features:**

* Menu with product categories (Electronics, Clothes, Food).
* Each category has **items and stock quantities** (use dictionary).
* Function `add_to_cart(item, qty)` checks stock and updates it.
* Function `checkout()` applies discount tiers:

  * ‚â•‚Ç±2000 ‚Üí 25%
  * ‚â•‚Ç±1000 ‚Üí 15%
  * ‚â•‚Ç±500 ‚Üí 10%
